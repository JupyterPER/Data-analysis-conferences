       "'The Principles of Teaching and Learning in STEM \\nEducation \\nP John Williams \\nCurtin University, Australia \\nEmail: pjohn.williams@curtin.edu.au \\nAbstract. The STEM space is very complex – the term has different meaning in different contexts, the STEM \\nsubjects do not have equivalence, projects may be after school or in the curriculum, assessment is problematic, the \\ngoals of STEM are multiple, and so on. This complexity makes it difficult to generalize about the nature of STEM \\nand of STEM teaching. However, there is a body of research about good teaching practice, which results in effective \\nlearning, and can be applied to the range of STEM activities. This presentation will select some principles of \\nteaching and learning, derived from research, and elaborates on the implications of their application to STEM \\nteaching. \\nKeywords: STEM education, Principles, Teaching and learning \\nINTRODUCTION \\nWe do not need to invent new pedagogies for the effective implementation of STEM Education. Over many \\nyears, research and practice have informed educators about what works in the classroom and leads to effective \\nlearning. This paper is a discussion of some of those principles, and the practices that derive from them. It is of \\ncourse not comprehensive, but is a snapshot which reflects my research and teaching experience. The principles \\nwhich are examined have been grouped into areas related to  processes, teaching, thinking, learning and \\nassessment. \\nI have made some assumptions here about the nature of STEM Education. I am not going to defend these \\nassumptions in this paper, but simply state that the principles that are discussed are grounded on these \\nassumptions. They are that STEM Education: \\n-  involves the integration of science, technology and mathematics, \\n-  is student centred, \\n-  engages students in collaborative activity, \\n-  focusses on processes, \\n-  occurs within the curriculum (is not extra-curricular), and  \\n-  is project and/or problem based. \\nProcesses \\nA process is a way of structuring student activity so that the desired outcomes are efficiently and effectively \\nachieved. There are a number of processes, which have a long history of research and implementation in \\neducation, which are particularly appropriate for STEM Education. They include: problem based, project based, \\ninquiry, and design. While each of these processes have a particular approach and emphasis, they all require \\nstudent engagement in the same types of activities. For example, they all require students to: \\n-  generate ideas \\n-  research and investigate \\n-  evaluate \\n-  model their ideas \\n-  identify needs \\n-  solve problems \\n-  document what they do \\n \\n  International Conference for Science Educators and Teachers (ISET) 2018\\nAIP Conf.
