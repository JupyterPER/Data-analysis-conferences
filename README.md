Our STEM education conference: **DIDSCI+2022** https://conf.ccvapp.upjs.sk/didsci2022/

Three other educational AIP conferences 
- **ISET 2018** https://aip.scitation.org/toc/apc/2081/1
- **DIDFYZ 2019** https://aip.scitation.org/toc/apc/2152/1
- **DIDFYZ 2021** https://aip.scitation.org/toc/apc/2152/1

One non-educational AIP conference in research and applications of renewable energy
- **ICORE 2019** (open access) https://aip.scitation.org/toc/apc/2228/1


## Results Background

To see results, *click* on a particular Jupyter notebook above, e.g. `DIDSCI+2022vsAIPconf.ipynb` or `ISET2018.ipynb`

The data analysis and statistics dealing with content, scope and quality of conferences were performed as a data science project by a group of students (special thanks to Dominik Borovský) from a course **Modern educational digital technology** taught by Jozef Hanč at P.J. Šafárik University in Košice, Slovakia.
 
Students coded and realized the data analysis in the modern open data science tool [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). Checking their code (16 notebooks & 2 own packages), verifying the correctness of their work and finalizing was done by Jozef Hanč. 

Our research deals with one of our data science research projects, mentioned below in Acknowledgements. Dominik Borovský is also a student research assistant whose work is directly connected to the project.

## Applied Python packages in Jupyter
- Scopus data for each AIP proceedings, its authors and contributions: [pybliometrics]( https://github.com/pybliometrics-dev/pybliometrics)  
(Rose, Michael E. and John R. Kitchin: ["pybliometrics: Scriptable bibliometrics using a Python interface to Scopus"](https://github.com/pybliometrics-dev/pybliometrics/blob/master/meta/1-s2.0-S2352711019300573-main.pdf), SoftwareX 10 (2019) 100263.)
- Web and pdf scrapping of AIP proceedings: [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber), [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Data manipulation, processing, analysis, visualization: [Scientific python packages pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn](https://projects.scipy.org/)

## Further applications
The developed algorithms and applied bibliometric analysis tools became regularly used in automatic systematic reviews of relevant research dealing with our
current projects supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under the Contract no. APVV-21-
0216 and APVV-21-0369.
