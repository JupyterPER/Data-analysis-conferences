- **DIDFYZ 2021** https://aip.scitation.org/toc/apc/2152/1

One non-educational AIP conference in research and applications of renewable energy
- **ICORE 2019** (open access) https://aip.scitation.org/toc/apc/2228/1


## Results Background

To see results, *click* on a particular Jupyter notebook above, e.g. `DIDSCI+2022vsAIPconf.ipynb` or `ISET2018.ipynb`

The data analysis and statistics dealing with content, scope and quality of conferences were performed as a data science project by a group of students (special thanks to Dominik Borovský) from a course **Modern educational digital technology** taught by Jozef Hanč at P.J. Šafárik university in Košice.
 
Students coded and realized the data analysis in the modern open data science tool [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). Checking their code, verifying the correctness of their work (16 notebooks & 2 own packages) and finalizing was done by Jozef Hanč. 

## Applied Python packages in Jupyter
- Scopus data for each AIP proceedings, its authors and contributions: [pybliometrics]( https://github.com/pybliometrics-dev/pybliometrics)  
(Rose, Michael E. and John R. Kitchin: ["pybliometrics: Scriptable bibliometrics using a Python interface to Scopus"](https://github.com/pybliometrics-dev/pybliometrics/blob/master/meta/1-s2.0-S2352711019300573-main.pdf), SoftwareX 10 (2019) 100263.)
